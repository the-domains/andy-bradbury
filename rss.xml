            <description><![CDATA[<p>New York has a history as long, if not longer, than some of the other places in this country that often flaunt the word "silicon" in their nicknames. And it's why, this weekend, the New York Historical Society is opening an half-year-long exhibit called Silicon City. "This is a story that has been forgotten by many, many people, especially after Northern California stole the spotlight," Louise Mirrer, president of the New York Historical Society, says.    The exhibit is heavily influenced by the 1964 World's Fair, which was held in Queens and played a big role in the popularization of computers. "Before then, computing was something that was thought of as business, science, even defense and military," Stephen Edidin, the museum's chief curator, says. "What happened at the fair is that computers were allowed to be presented to everybody."        Much of this happened in what's known as "The Egg," IBM's dome-shaped pavilion at the fair. Visitors to the Silicon City exhibit begin their journey in a small-scale version of The Egg, where they can watch footage of those fair-goers experiencing computers for the first time.  After this, the exhibit really begins, transforming into a physical timeline of computing in New York. You could, honestly, move through the entire thing in less than 30 seconds. It's not massive by any means. But with more than 300 items, you'd be wise to take as much time as you can. Maybe you've never seen a 5 1/4 floppy disk before, or played Space Invaders on an original cabinet. Maybe you never saw the first transatlantic satellite broadcast, or the satellite that made it possible. Maybe you didn't even know these things existed.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The one thing you never hear about Khalif Diouf is how much he laughs.  In general, the native New York rapper — better known as Le1f — is portrayed as a soft-spoken, yet deadly serious provocateur wholly dedicated to his bawdy, politically charged party raps. He helps that image along, of course: confrontational onstage, always strictly composed and mean-mugging like a couture model in photoshoots, and ready to unleash a social media beatdown on anyone unwise enough to call him transphobic or make bigoted comments about his career.  But in person, that all melts away with the arrival of his big, endearing exclamation point of a chortle, one that bursts loudly and often over whatever space he happens to inhabit — for example, a beige booth in a Midtown Manhattan diner, talking to a reporter about X-Men.  "I was just into mutant… situations," he says of his nerdy childhood, laughing over a plate of plain French toast. (They were out of cinnamon-raisin bread.) He’s ordered a pitcher of water, too, worried he’s getting sick before his CMJ show at Williamsburg’s Cameo Gallery later this week. "I always liked Iceman, but he just came out of the closet. He said he didn’t want to before because he didn’t want to deal with the double-discrimination. I’m like, ‘Whatever, I’ve been a gay black dude my whole life. Get over it.’"</p>]]></description>
